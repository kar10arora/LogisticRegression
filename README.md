Project Description: Breast Cancer Classification Using Logistic Regression
Objective:

Develop a predictive model to classify breast cancer as benign or malignant.
Dataset:

Used the Breast Cancer dataset containing the following columns:
Sample code number
Clump Thickness
Uniformity of Cell Size
Uniformity of Cell Shape
Marginal Adhesion
Single Epithelial Cell Size
Bare Nuclei
Bland Chromatin
Normal Nucleoli
Mitoses
Class (target variable: 2 for benign, 4 for malignant)
Preprocessing:

Handled missing values by imputing or removing rows/columns.
Normalized or standardized feature columns to improve model performance.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Modeling:

Applied Logistic Regression to model the relationship between features and the target variable.
Used the logistic function to predict the probability of cancer being malignant or benign.
Training:

Trained the Logistic Regression model using the training dataset.
Utilized optimization techniques to minimize the cost function and improve accuracy.
Evaluation:

Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Validated the model with the testing dataset to ensure generalization.
Results:

Achieved a satisfactory classification performance, accurately distinguishing between benign and malignant cases.
Identified key features contributing to the prediction, aiding in understanding cancer diagnosis.
Conclusion:

Demonstrated the effectiveness of Logistic Regression in medical diagnostics.
Provided a reliable tool for early detection of breast cancer, potentially aiding healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.
